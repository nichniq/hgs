In each of these four works there is an attempt to connect specific parts of the sculpture with a particular piece of classical drapery and/or contemporary images of war. I don’t expect the viewer to make specific compositional connections, what I do hope is that there is a rush of emotion—a frisson. A shutter of understanding induced by the resemblance between a form discovered in the sculpture, and another found where memory lives within the viewer.

My early training was academic, learning how to model in clay a realistic portrait and the human figure. The first series of independent works were hammered steel forms made from a flat sheet, a rigid, formed membrane or skin with little reference to the human body. Then, in a return to the figure by way of organic form, I reduced the body to its most basic physicality: hard and soft, membrane and support, skin and bone. These sculptures have a canvas membrane outer surface, and a plywood endoskeletal structure within. In each work there is an interior structure that retains some direct reference to the human body or other organic forms.

The surface configuration of the canvas was the result of the wooden structure it was attached to. These sculptures are composed of a series of independent segments, thought of as a linear sequence, but radiating around a vertical axis, an aspect that later becomes important in Space-holds, which follow. As important as the formal structures and sequences were to me, of far greater significance was the possibility that a particular sculpture could evoke in the mind of the viewer organic nonfigurative forms found in the natural world.

Each sculpture in this series is based on a particular historic work. The first, *The Lapith*, began with my interest in the implied movement and majestic narrative drapery in this particular metope from the Parthenon. The sculpture defines a space infused with the memory of this classical relief.

In this two-part sculpture, *The Visit and the Apparition*, the drapery in one section is based upon the central figure in a painting by Balthus entitled *The Room* (1947–48). It resembles a wing, which in turn brought to mind the angel’s wing in the *Annunciation* by Fra Angelico (1438), which is outlined in the forged-steel second section.

Light-Reflection-Space is a seven-part work based upon three views of the *Winged Victory of Samothrace* in the Louvre. The three vertical sections attached to the central right triangle mark three segments of the original classical sculpture in which I questioned whether they alone could suffice for the original.

The three forged steel screens are based on the primary forms found in the bronze reliefs. The sculpture is meant to be placed within the building seen in the last two drawings. The significance of this piece for me lies in part in the large open circular skylight in the center of the building. Can natural light and the bronze images transmit the memory of the original Greek sculpture through time and over distance?

The final sculpture in this section is based on the *Ludovica Albertoni* by Bernini. Specifically, the work was my attempt to address the paradox that I felt in the original sculpture. The violent convulsion of Ludovica’s ecstasy is represented on one side of the white wall while her repose within the recalled tranquility of the chapel with its filtered light and compressed space is rendered on the other.

As the narrative possibilities of still life objects and their shadows became more limiting, I found the expressive potential inherent in the portrait head to be far more challenging. I wanted to continue utilizing the shadow as a primary form, but here more as a metaphoric and expressive extension of the head. As metaphor or simile, the shadow has a rich history: *The Republic* by Plato (*The Cave*), *Peter Schlemihl* by Chamisso, and *Die Frau ohne Schatten* by Richard Strauss, to name only three. In these works the shadow represents the other aspect of our corporeal being—the doppelgänger—the non-material illusion of who we are.

Stone is the ideal material here because the solidity of its physical presence is the antithesis of the shadow. Each sculpture in this series of portraits of artists began with a found photograph of the person, an image that I felt was particularly insightful as a compelling photo/portrait in its own right. The point was not to make a likeness in the normal sense; rather, what I was after was an aura of the individual recalled through the filter of time and revealed by the process of carving. The best example of what I’m referring to is the *Shadow Portraits of Eileen Gray*. At one end of the sculpture there is the partial image of her face as a youthful woman; at the other end is the elderly woman with a covered eye. The many sheets of glass between cast reflections back and forth and contain the numerous converging and overlaid “shadow” images of these two moments from her long life.

These four represent a continuation of many of the same concerns found in the previous stones. Drapery, which presented the sculptors of antiquity with the opportunity to inject abstraction into figurative compositions is present in all my work over the past fifteen years. True, but especially so in #1 where I use white silk and marble to emphasize the sameness of differences. At times It’s hard to tell where one ends and the other begins. Also, of prime concern is that each is composed of more than one stone, and each has a specific found photo as a starting point.

### Improvisation and Direct Carving

Improvisation is one of the key elements of jazz. As a static object in space, sculpture resists analogies between it and music, but it is in their creation that the two may draw near. Most of the materials and techniques of sculpture allow for some degree of revision. This is not true with respect to the direct carving of stone. The jazz musician can improvise within an already composed theme, or freely and spontaneously react to the moment. In those instants, unconstrained by a score, there is the opportunity to create music that belongs only to the musician, and to a moment in time. With that freedom comes the possibility of failure.

My starting point for a sculpture is usually a photograph, but soon it’s put aside and other images and possibilities come to mind. It is fair to say that improvisation may begin here. But because I have a general feeling for where the sculpture is going, I resist using the word—improvisation—at this point. I do so because it’s the next level—the unknown—where the word seems most appropriate. This is where clarity of form is beyond my reach. Here I’m free to draw upon all that I know and have experienced; this is where the phrase improvisational carving fairly describes my process. It’s here the question of where and what to carve are filled with both possibility and doubt. And it’s here that the risk of doing irretrievable harm—what is cut off cannot be returned—is greatest. But in these periods of relative freedom the process seems to carry me along. I have no alternative but to follow. In these moments of bliss, apart from any predetermined methodology, the sculpture seems to make itself.

I gained from the previous Historical Works a renewed respect for the power of the told story and the obvious centrality of the human figure as its narrative focus.

These works result from an insight into how one’s understanding and emotional response to any given sculptural form may be changed by variations in light and shadow. We perceive shadow to be a lightless silhouette. In actuality, it is an invisible darkened volume projected from an object that blocks the light. Shadows are defined by the light that they shine through. In that limited respect shadow is similar to the volume of space defined within the previous Space-hold sculptures. Shadow is a darkened volume contained within an envelope of light; space is a light-filled volume held within an envelope of wood or metal.

Once the analogy between the shadow and the Space-holds became apparent, I explored the shadow’s expressive possibilities within the context of common objects found in the traditional still life, specifically the shadows of a knife, a bowl and a bottle. These sculptures opened the possibility of narrative storytelling between parts and whole and between the historic tradition of painting and contemporary sculpture.

At each of the six corners will be one of my stone sculptures from the series: This Child (2004-2008) While these stone portrait heads endeavor to convey aspects of the devastating birth defects and death that Agent Orange exacted on innocent Vietnamese children and their families, the central garden personifies the healing power and beauty of nature. The essence of the Memorial is the opposition between these two forces. In total here is a place where the visitor may meditate on the profound and lasting consequences of each.

// A wedge-like construction half in a forest of trees, and half in the adjacent clearing. As you can see from the photos the wedge or V-like form was defined by a series of poles. At the point where the wedge intersects the forest/clearing, the poles support a curved wooden encloser. These boards have been cut so they conform to a forced illusory one-point perspective that either appears to compress or lengthen the interior volume of space within. The tops of all the poles are cut to define a flat plane relative to the sloping ground of the clearing. Of all the Space-holds I feel this was the most successful, in part because of the scale of the work. Here the viewer can walk within the sculpture and thus interact with it.

I began by questioning many of the basic assumptions made in the canvas and wood works, in one case using an open spatial form in contrast to the apparent solidity of the previous pieces. I thought of these sculptures initially as a literal opening-out or uncoiling of the canvas membrane works. These are a linear, sequential, sometimes mathematical progression, while the canvas and wood works were more capricious, and circular in their basic segmented forms. The exoskeleton supporting structure allowed me to focus attention on the passive enclosed spatial volume within. They resemble in their basic conception the interiors of Romanesque cathedrals, with an important exception.

I changed their orientation to open the sculptures to the natural light and sky above. These were the first purely formalist, non-figurative large-scale works that I had made, and my first experiments with and explorations of the use of space, volume and two-dimensional perspective to an expressive, aesthetic end. This series culminates with Clearing-Spacehold-Forest, a sculpture scaled to permit the viewer to walk through, around and into its volumes. It is also site-specific in that the basic aspects of the site—a clearing, a forest and the natural slope of the land—determined many of the major aspects, dimensions and configuration of the work.

These developed from Clearing-Spacehold-Forest in the previous section and from the use of the forced one-point perspective found in that work. I wanted the sculpture to appear, depending upon where the viewer was standing, to be either longer or shorter than it was in actuality, thus visually extending or compressing the perceived contained volumes of space within. With the Space-screens I created a fictional, three-dimensional space/volume that was controlled by the structural elements that define it, as well as continuing to explore assumptions having to do with how space is perceived.

I soon saw that these works would have to be monumental in scale to work properly for the viewer, so I made several attempts to construct them in large open spaces within New York City. They were my last efforts at strictly formalist, non-figurative work. I wanted to return to where I had started, but with the knowledge and experience gained from these intervening fifteen years of making sculpture.

In many respects these works are a continuation of previous sculptures in that they are based upon aspects of photographs of victims of war, classical drapery, and in two cases—my hands. The primary difference here is that I am combining two stones and I make the juncture between them the focus of the work. A simple question is embedded in these sculptures: What is the difference between part and whole in any physical object?  How do I know where one begins and the other leaves off?

In the mid 1990’s, at the time of the Bosnian war and the ongoing terrorism in the Middle East, there was no shortage of appalling images of war to be found in books and the press. It was at this time that I decided to move my work away from the narrow confines of the studio and attempt to create sculpture that in some way addresses the pathos expressed in these photographs. To make work that might in some way dignify the innocent victims of these conflicts.

Where to begin? I felt that the plight of Agent Orange children in Vietnam might be a possibility as these war crimes affected innocent children and so are the most heinous.

Once the primary image was established, next came the choice of a material. I decided upon the most traditional—stone. And the focus of both form and content would be the portrait head and an esthetic paradox. On one side all stones were carefully chosen for their sensual beauty. But these heads depict the terrifying images of war. It is this tension between the horrific, and the material beauty that is central to the emotional presence felt in these stones.

Last in this incomplete catalogue of my work is a proposed: *Memorial to the Innocent Victims of War*. These stones will inhabit this memorial.
